All shaders mentioned below have been tested on a M1 Mac mini. The game runs natively without Rosetta 2 emulation (allows for a more stable game with higher FPS). To know how to do this go there: https://github.com/yusefnapora/m1-multimc-hack

## 07/06/2021: INFO: For the moment, the following shaders have been tested only with OptiFine (1.16.5 and 1.17.1), but a test with Iris will be added soon...
## 08/05/2021: UPDATE: Some of these shaders aren't working with Iris.
## 02/18/2022: UPDATE: If you tested this shaders natively on a Mac equippped with the M1 Pro/Max chip, please contact me on Discord: Moustache#0001


## Most used (for M1): Sildur's Enhanced Default

Running perfectly at 140-200 FPS. (adds graphical improvements and waving plants)

## Best for adventure: Chocapic13 HighPerformance

Running really good at 150-220 FPS (Low version) and 280-360 FPS (Potato version).
The Low version has got better graphics and the Potato version has better FPS.

The shaders adds Better Graphics, Waving Plants and Better Shades and Shadows.

## Most realistic: projectLuma

Running at 40-70 FPS, the shader adds realistic improvements like: Better sun, better water, waving plants, better shadows, better stars, better moon etc…
This isn't the best shader for performance but it is one of the best for taking screenshots.

## Sildur's Shaders

It is most used of shaders and the one that combines all the qualities: good performance and a lot of features. It adds almost everything mentioned above.
I recommend using the High version of the v1.20 (the newer versions are completely unplayable and the graphics are worse). It runs on this version at ≈ 65 FPS.

## KUDA Shaders

The KUDA Shaders are a good alternative to the Sildurs Shaders. It runs at 50-55 FPS. I recommend using the v6.5.56 because the the v6.1 Legacy doesn't works and sometimes crashes the game.

## SEUS Renewed (fixed version)

![SEUSRenewedMaxSettings1080](https://i.goopics.net/ehb9ts.png)

Sonic Ether's Unbelievable Shaders are known to give incredible graphics as well as being very performance intensive. Here, I'm using a modified version of the shaders to fix the OpenGL issue but the game is barely playable at max settings (Render quality: 2 ; Shadows quality: 2 etc…) If you want to download the fix for the shaders, here's the link: https://www.mediafire.com/file/pwupji700igvf7l/SEUS-Renewed-v1.0.1_applesilicon-fixed.zip/file

## Sora Shaders

Sora Shaders are a glitchy alternative to Sildurs Shaders. There are some problems with the rendering of the water and the lighting effects are much worse. If you are looking for an alternative to Sildurs, choose the KUDA Shaders above.

## Simplicissimus

The Simplicissimus works great on the M1 chip. It adds a remarquable fog effect. It runs at 90-160 FPS

## Tea Shaders

The Tea Shaders are a laggy version of Simplicissimus. It runs at ≈ 10 FPS.

## Chocapic13' Shaders

Most versions of Chocapic13' Shaders will not work on M1 Macs. However, V7.x works (Toaster, High, Ultra, and Extreme are not functional). It gets 80-120 FPS on Medium version.

## I just saw this repo that claims to provide "M1-optimized" shaders: https://github.com/mhossein1384/Multimc-Optifine-1.18/releases, you should try it.
