# Overview of Minecraft shaders on M1 Macs

View the full list of shaders with their performance details [here](DATA.md).

It is recommended to run the game with an [optimization modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sop) and [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris),
on a launcher that supports the game natively (without running through Rosetta 2) such as [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/).
