All shaders mentioned below have been tested on a Mac mini M1. The game runs natively without Rosetta 2 emulation (allows for a more stable game with higher FPS). To know how to do this go here: https://github.com/yusefnapora/m1-multimc-hack

## Most used (for M1): Sildur's Enhanced Default

Running perfectly at 140-200 FPS. (adds graphical improvements and waving plants)

## Best for adventure: Chocapic13 HighPerformance

Running really good at 150-220 FPS (Low version) and 280-360 FPS (Potato version).
The Low version has got better graphics and the Potato version has better FPS.

The shaders adds Better Graphics, Waving Plants and Better Shades and Shadows.

## Most realistic: projectLuma

Running at 40-70 FPS, the shader adds realistic improvements like: Better sun, better water, waving plants, better shadows, better stars, better moon etc…
This isn't the best shader for performance but it is one of the best for taking screenshots.

## Sildur's Shaders

It is most used of shaders and the one that combines all the qualities. Good performance and a lot of features. It adds almost everything mentioned above.
I recommend using the High version of the v1.20 (the newer version are completely unplayable and the graphics are worse). It runs on this version a ≈ 65 FPS.

## KUDA Shaders

The KUDA Shaders are a good alternative to the Sildurs Shaders. It runs at 50-55 FPS. I recommend using the v6.5.56 because the the v6.1 Legacy doesn't works and sometimes crashes the game.

## Sora Shaders

Sora Shaders are a glitchy alternative to Sildurs Shaders. There are some problems with the rendering of the water and the lighting effects are much worse. If you are looking for an alternative to Sildurs, choose the KUDA Shaders above.

## Simplicissimus

The Simplicissimus works great on the M1 chip. It adds a remarquable fog effect. It runs at 90-160 FPS

## Tea Shaders

The Tea Shaders are a laggy version of Simplicissimus. It runs at ≈ 10 FPS.
